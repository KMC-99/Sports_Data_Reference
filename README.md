# README 

Figured I would use this as a repo to document and update where to find data for various different sports.

The goal is to make it a bit easier for people to find whatever sports data they are looking for. 

## Languages 

Feel free to add info on other languages etc. In the future, I (or we) can document where to find APIs. 

[R Packages](R/Data.md)  
[Python](Python/Data.md)   
[JS](JS/Data.md)  
[.NET](.NET/Data.md)  

## API/DATA

[API](API/Data.md)
[Raw Data](Raw_Data/Data.md)
